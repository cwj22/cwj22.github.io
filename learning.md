### Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning

<div class="prof-head">
<p><b>Skill-Critic</b>: Refining Learned Skills for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning </p>
</div>
<blockquote>
Our Skill-Critic algorithm optimizes both the low and high-level policies of a hierarchial agent, AND these policies are  initialized and regularized by a latent space learned from offline demonstrations to guide the joint policy optimization. We validate our approach in multiple sparse RL environments, including a new sparse reward autonomous racing task in Gran Turismo Sport. The experiments show that Skill-Critic's low-level policy fine-tuning and demonstration-guided regularization are essential for optimal performance.
