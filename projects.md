My research explores planning and control of complex robotic systems, merging techniques from
engineering and model-based control with advances in computer science and machine learning. My
work particularly emphasizes challenging robotics problems that are difficult even for the average
human operator to perform, such as vehicle racing, where there is often limited access to large expert
datasets and optimal control can be difficult to quantify. I leverage model-based control and machine
learning to advance the capabilities of control algorithms
