## Model-Based Planning and Control
State-of-the-art model-based planning and control methods can achieve impressive performance by using physical models to inform the planning and control problems. In addition to robotic systems, I helped develop a model of a micro-combined heat and power system (micro-CHP) in Figure 1. The micro-CHP consists of a fuel cell, whose water-based coolant system stores waste heat for household use. By modeling the fuel cell and coolant line, I developed a model that was later used for planning and control.$^1$ In autonomous racing at the limits of handling, nonlinear tire dynamics have a large effect on traction and overall vehicle dynamics, and we thoroughly investigated the effects of different model considerations of a dynamic bicycle model (Figure 2).
 In particular, we explored separate planning and control modules consisting of an offline trajectory planner and an online Model Predictive Control (MPC) tracking controller.$^2$
Our proposed high fidelity model-based control framework can achieve top $0.95\%$ lap time among human-expert players in GTS.
