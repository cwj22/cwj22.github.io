## About Me

Welcome to my online portfolio! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley advised by Masayoshi Tomizuka. My research focuses on advanced control systems, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. I received an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UC Berkeley in 2021 and a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University in 2019.

I am seeking roles where I can apply my expertise in reinforcement learning, control systems, and artificial intelligence. I am interested in becoming involved in cutting-edge research and development that solves real-world problems. See the links to the left for more information, and please feel free to contact me.
