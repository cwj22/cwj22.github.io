- Conducted 5-year research project in collaboration with Sony AI to advance learning-based control algorithms for autonomous racing in the challenging, high-fidelity simulator Gran Turismo Sport
- Implemented and improved many cutting edge, popular ML and RL algorithms by leveraging my deep understanding of their mathematical derivation and theoretical basis for algorithmic choices
- Tackled <span style="color:#F3B507;"><b><i>learning from human demonstrations</i></b></span> by leveraging RL with generative adversarial networks and proposed a new imitation-based decision transformer with corrective online rollouts
- Derived a novel hierarchical RL algorithm with learned skills that shows significant improvement over existing methods in <span style="color:#F3B507;"><b><i>long-horizon</i></b></span> robotic manipulation (Fetch), maze (D4RL), and racing (Gran Turismo) tasks
- Effectively communicated in regular research presentations and seminars for various audiences and exhibited high-quality technical writing and edit ing of applications and scientific papers
- Showed leadership and long-term vision when <span style="color:#F3B507;"><b><i>mentoring 4 graduate students</i></b></span> visiting from other universities that resulted in multiple publications and continuous improvement of a unified control system

- Proposed a novel motion primitive formulation for online racing trajectory planning, resulting in ongoing collaboration with top robotics researchers and paper submission to competitive controls conference
- After inspecting companyâ€™s existing <span style="color:#D2007B;"><b><i> racing MPC</i></b></span>  implementation, suggested and executed algorithmic improvements that increased tracking performance and decreased lap-time by 4 seconds
- Merged multiple branches with new features to a Github repository with 30+ contributors and wrote code that adhered to <span style="color:#D2007B;"><b><i> unit testing, typing,</i></b></span>  and <span style="color:#D2007B;"><b><i> style</i></b></span>  requirements to pass peer and manager code reviews
