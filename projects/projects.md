## Research Projects

My research explores planning and control of complex robotic systems, merging techniques from
**engineering and model-based control** with **advances in computer science and machine learning.**

In particular, autonomous vehicle racing is a complicated challenge even for many humans to successfully perform. I have worked in collaboration with ![Sony AI](https://cwj22.github.io/professional/sony.html) _for four years_ to tackle autonomous racing in Gran Turismo Sport (GTS).

- End-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) can improve an agent's policy through environment interaction.
- Adversarial imitation learning (AIL) builds on RL to learn without access to a reward function by exploiting GANs
- I improve AIL's performance in GTS by exploring residual policy learning, exploration with model-based control, options framework for semi-MDPS, and sparse reward guidance

Autonomous racing is a complex problem: the vehicle should be controlled at its limit of handling _and_ achieve top racing performance.  However, my planning, control, and machine learning algorithms are not limited to autonomous racing, and in the future I plan to expand into other challenging domains, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, commercial autonomous driving, mobile robots, and industrial robotics.
