## Research Projects

My research explores planning and control of complex robotic systems, merging techniques from
**engineering and model-based control** with **advances in computer science and machine learning.**

In particular, autonomous vehicle racing is a complicated challenge even for many humans to successfully perform. As a graduate research fellow in the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, I have worked in collaboration with [Sony AI](https://www.ai.sony/projects/gaming_ai/) _for four years_ to tackle autonomous racing in Gran Turismo Sport (GTS).

[Model-based control](./projects/mpc.html)

[Thermal system modeling and control](./projects/microCHP.html)


Autonomous racing is a complex problem: the vehicle should be controlled at its limit of handling _and_ achieve top racing performance.  However, my planning, control, and machine learning algorithms **are not limited to autonomous racing**, and in the future I plan to expand into other challenging domains, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, commercial autonomous driving, mobile robots, and industrial robotics.
