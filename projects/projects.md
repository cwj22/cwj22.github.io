My research explores planning and control of complex robotic systems, merging techniques from
engineering and model-based control with advances in computer science and machine learning. My
work particularly emphasizes challenging robotics problems that are difficult even for the average
human operator to perform, such as vehicle racing, where there is often limited access to large expert
datasets and optimal control can be difficult to quantify. I leverage model-based control and machine
learning to advance the capabilities of control algorithms




Autonomous racing has become a popular sub-topic of autonomous driving in recent years and is a complex problem: the vehicle must be controlled at its limit of handling and achieve human-level racing performance. I have worked in collaboration with Sony AI for four years to tackle the challenge of autonomous racing in the  high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo Sport (GTS). However, my planning, control, and machine learning algorithms are not limited to autonomous racing, and in the future I plan to expand into other challenging robotic domains, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous driving in urban environments, mobile robots, and industrial robotics.
